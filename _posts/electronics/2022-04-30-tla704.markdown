# Synopsis
This page will document the repairs and upgrades I went through for recently acquired TLA704.

# Background
I tend to mess around with various digital circuits so I have always wanted a decent logic analyzer and I am fan of vintage electronics and their idiosyncrasies, so this seemed like a good way to resolve both. Specifically, I acquired this TLA704 for around $50 off of ebay with a couple of known issues.


# RTC Clock Repair
I knew immediately when I bought it that it would have an RTC failure (seller showed a picture of this) but I didn't realise the RTC was a custom IC with no replaceable battery. To resolve that issues I followed this [youtuber's guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daoxD-SS3ZU) on modding that IC to have a CMOS battery attachment. It was gross procedure but it did indeed work and fix the issue.
