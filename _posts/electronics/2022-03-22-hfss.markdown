# Synopsis
This page will document some of my experience of working with HFSS.

# Background
I work in a Cubesat Lab at ASU and am electrical engineer with an RF Focus. I was bound to eventually start using this software. So I decided to try it.

# Installation
If you are student, you can just utilize Ansys's provided free trial of it. Doesn't last terribly long but is sufficient for getting started.

# Good Starting Tutorial
HFSS is limited to antenna testing but with my focus on RF design, [Ansys's Dipole Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUC720AJvK0) is rather useful. It goes through some helpful tips so that your model is properly parameterizd to eventually far field plots + other useful plots.
