# Synopsis
 This article will be summarizing the work in progress custom blinker module for Mercedes W116 300SD (soon for a more universal blinker module)

# Background
My roommate got a W116 300sd which was a bit of a work in progress car and has been working on repairing and fixing it. One of the first issue we had with it was the blinker module failing and staying on. These blinker modules are quite exexpensive even for just used modules (~50 for a used and more) and brand new ones are not really made. So making a new design was a more reasonable option. This ended up taking much longer than originally planned and is now on V4.1 so figured I would share what I have and eventually sell the blinker module for other W116 owners.

# Requirements
 - Fit the similar form factor of the W116 Blinker Module
 - Work with 10V to 12V range for input voltage.
 - Support modern LED bulbs as well as Incadescent bulbs.
 - Reprogrammable to add features in the future.
 - Support faulty blinker detection (i.e loss of light, etc).

# Module Features
 - Custom programmable blinker fault detection using blinker stock only and no other functionality.
 - Supports 10V to 12V range for input voltage
 - Supports modern LED bulbs and Incadescent Bulbs.
