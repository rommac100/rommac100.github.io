# This page will be detailing most of the information that pertains to my current laptop config.

Current Physical Setup:
	- Dell XPS 15 9550
		- 16 GB DDR3
		- 1 TB NVME
		- i7 6700HQ
		- 4K Displays
  	- Old Fujitsu Keyboard
  	- Logitech G502
  	- Dual Dell 24'' Monitors
This current Physical setup is semi-temporary and is only used for my summer-internship. When at college I just use the Laptop with its standard config. The laptop was mostly picked for the fact that it can be picked for fairly cheap ($500 on ebay when bought used) but it is still fairly reasonably speced and has a physically well built chassis.

Current Software / Operating System Config:
	- Manjaro 
	- Window Manager - i3
	- Firefox Developer Edition
	- vim
	- Various other IDEs for software development
**Manjaro** was choosen to limit the resource usage that the operating system takes from the laptop. Also I have been using arch for 4 ish years so Manjaro was closen enough and allowed for a faster initial install.
**i3** was chosen for the same reason as above with the addition that I typically avoid using the trackpad as much as possible due to the inefficiency of using a mouse. So i3 is the perfect WM to pair with the ideology. Also, the simplicity and customized ability of i3 is appreciated. 
The editor **vim** I recently switched to due to a friend recommending that I switch to it after I convinced him to switch to **i3**. I could be happier with the decision as I already use terminal programs heavily (evidented by the website's theme choice) and vim pairs perfectly with this behaviour. There is definetly a bit of learning curve but if you force yourself to use it for nearly everything, you will get passed the curve quickly. However, that is just initial curve and there is a whole additional curve that beyond just being proficient with vim. I have not even gotten close to that curve.
