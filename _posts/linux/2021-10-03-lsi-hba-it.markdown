# Summary
 This article is more of a link dump for flashing the firmware of a LSI controller. Specifically, it mode will be flashed onto the controller given that is necessary for zfs utilization.

# LSI 9211-8i
 *notes most of the steps are probably universal for most lsi cards but I will just separate them like this in case of changes*
More or less just check out the linked guide on it but in summary:
 - Download the firmware for the [9211-8i](https://www.broadcom.com/support/download-search)
	- Serach for 9211 and grab the it firmware on that download search.
 - Copy the following files onto the root of fat32 bootable dos device
    - sasbios_rel/mptsas2.rom
    - Firmware/HBA_9211_8i_IT/2118.bin
    - sas2flsh_dos_rel/sas2flsh.exe
 - Run the following commands after booting into your usb (DO NOT REBOOT during install process)
``` bash
sas2flsh -o -e 6 (setting the adapter and flashing mode effectively)
sas2flsh -o -f 2118it.bin -b mptsas2.rom (flash the firmware)
sas2flsh -listall (verify installation was successful)
```
