# Synopsis
 Oh boy Containerization. The modern hip term in virtualization. Effectively, just light weight vms that share more resources than normal ones (typically the host's kernel). Typically, containers have less overhead so are often desigated to being individual "isolation chambers" for applications. In my case, I am using proxmox and various lxc containers with even nested docker containers inside them to operate my media server.
