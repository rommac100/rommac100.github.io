# Welcome
 This blog will mostly be dedicated to various experiences I have had with electronics based projects. This will range from low-level circuitry and microcontrollers all the way up to Virtual Machines and GPU passthrough. Probably some random misc stuff will exist so just use the top bar to navigate to each category.
