# Notes about running local copy
## Dependencies:
 More or less just bundle, gem, ruby, and jekyll are the primary dependencies. Best to look how to do it on your own.
## config change:
 Uncomment out the
 ```bash
	#theme: jekyll-theme-console
 ``` in the _config.yml. Make sure this is commented out when pushed to the repo though otherwise github pages will refuse to run it.
