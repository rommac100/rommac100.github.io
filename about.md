# General Background 
I am current Electrical Engineering Student Arizona State University with a focus on integrated circuits and low-level software development. I also have a decent background in Robotics and Robotics based competitions (FTC, FRC, etc.). However, I still will often work with things that user actually interacts with such as Virtual Machines, and Linux related stuff.
