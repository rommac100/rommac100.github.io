# General Background 
I am currently an Electrical Engineering Student at Arizona State University with a focus on integrated circuits and low-level software development. I also have a decent amount of background in Robotics and Robotics based competitions (FTC, FRC, etc.). However, I still will often work with things that users actually interacts with such as Virtual Machines, and Linux related stuff.
